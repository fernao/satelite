## Requirements

Satelite is a bash script, so it must be run specially under GNU/Linux or Unix compatible system. The dependencies are the following:
- bash
- wget
- cron
- md5sum / sha256 etc


## Installation

Simply place this folder in a computer that stays connected - like a server - and set a cron job to run every hour or in a user defined interval:

$ crontab -e

1 * * * * /path/to/satelite/satelite.sh

## Configuring websites to grab images

For each single image that you want to grab, add a website-imagename.conf file under the "conf" file. The file is simple, and takes only two arguments:

IMAGES_FOLDER=""   # the name of the folder where the images will be stored
SRC=""   # the url of the images
