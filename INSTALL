## Requirements

Satelite is writter in python 2.7. It depends on the following libraries:
sys, os, re, urllib, time, json and logging


## Installation

Simply place this folder in a computer that stays connected - like a server - and set a cron job to run every hour or in a user defined interval:

$ crontab -e

1 * * * *  python /path/to/satelite/satelite.py

## Configuring websites to grab images

For each single image that you want to grab, add a website-imagename.json file under the "sources" file. It's a json file, and takes three arguments:

{
 "name": "your-source",
 "description": "Source institution / satellite name / whatever",
 "src": "http://your-url.com/image.jpg"
}
